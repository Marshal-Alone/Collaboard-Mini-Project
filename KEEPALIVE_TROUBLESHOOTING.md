# Keep-Alive Troubleshooting & Issues Log

## üìù Overview
This document records all issues encountered during the keep-alive implementation, their root causes, and solutions. Use this as a reference when implementing in new projects.

---

## üêõ Issues Encountered & Solutions

### Issue #1: Render Server Takes 15 Minutes to Wake Up

**Problem**: 
When users visited the Vercel-hosted frontend after Render backend was inactive for 15+ minutes, the server took up to 15 minutes to respond.

**Root Cause**:
- Render free tier shuts down after 15 minutes of inactivity
- No keep-alive mechanism was in place
- Backend only woke up when actual user requests came in
- Cold start process is slow

**Solution Implemented**:
1. Created `keepalive.js` service that runs in the frontend
2. Sends immediate ping when ANY page loads
3. Uses two-tier interval system:
   - 2 minutes (aggressive) for first 3 pings
   - 4 minutes (maintenance) after server is warm
4. Automatically switches back to aggressive mode on failures

**Code Location**:
- `frontend/keepalive.js` (entire file)
- Added to all HTML pages in `<head>` section

**Verification**:
```javascript
// In browser console after page load:
[KeepAlive] Service initialized
[KeepAlive] Ping successful (server was cold, took 14.2s)
[KeepAlive] Ping successful (523ms)
[KeepAlive] Server warmed up, switching to maintenance interval: 240 seconds
```

### Issue #2: Keep-Alive Only Worked on Homepage

**Problem**: 
Keep-alive script was only included in `index.html`, so when users directly visited other pages (like `/board` or `/auth`), the server didn't wake up.

**Root Cause**:
- `keepalive.js` script tag was missing from other HTML files
- Each page loads independently, so needs its own script inclusion

**Solution Implemented**:
Added `<script src="keepalive.js"></script>` to ALL HTML pages:
- `index.html` ‚úÖ
- `auth.html` ‚úÖ
- `board.html` ‚úÖ
- `health.html` ‚úÖ
- `page2.html` ‚úÖ
- Any future HTML files

**Code Example**:
```html
<head>
    <title>Your Page</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
    <script src="keepalive.js"></script> <!-- ADD THIS -->
    <script type="module" src="script.js"></script>
</head>
```

**Verification**:
Visit any page and check browser console for:
```
[KeepAlive] Service initialized
[KeepAlive] API URL: <correct URL>
[KeepAlive] Service started with aggressive wake-up strategy
```

---

### Issue #3: Duplicate Script Loading in auth.html

**Problem**: 
`auth.html` had `keepalive.js` included twice, causing the service to initialize multiple times.

**Root Cause**:
- Script was added in `<head>` section
- Script was also added before `</head>` closing tag during updates

**Solution Implemented**:
Removed the duplicate script tag:
```html
<!-- BEFORE (Wrong - Duplicate) -->
<head>
    <script src="keepalive.js"></script>
    ...
    <script src="keepalive.js"></script> <!-- Duplicate! -->
</head>

<!-- AFTER (Correct) -->
<head>
    <script src="keepalive.js"></script>
    ...
</head>
```

**How to Check**:
```bash
# In project root:
grep -r "keepalive.js" frontend/*.html

# Should show exactly ONE occurrence per file
```

**Verification**:
- No duplicate initialization messages in console
- Only one keep-alive service instance

---

### Issue #4: CORS Errors When Pinging from Vercel

**Problem**: 
When frontend was deployed to Vercel and tried to ping Render backend, CORS errors occurred.

**Root Cause**:
Backend wasn't configured to accept cross-origin requests from Vercel domain.

**Solution Implemented**:
Added CORS middleware in `backend/server.js` BEFORE all routes:

```javascript
// Add CORS middleware to allow health checks from anywhere
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
    res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS');
    res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept, Authorization');
    
    // Handle preflight requests
    if (req.method === 'OPTIONS') {
        return res.sendStatus(200);
    }
    
    next();
});
```

**Location**: `backend/server.js` (lines ~65-77)

**Alternative Solution** (More Restrictive):
```javascript
const allowedOrigins = [
    'http://localhost:5050',
    'https://your-app.vercel.app',
    'https://your-custom-domain.com'
];

app.use((req, res, next) => {
    const origin = req.headers.origin;
    if (allowedOrigins.includes(origin)) {
        res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', origin);
    }
    // ... rest of CORS headers
});
```

**Verification**:
- No CORS errors in browser console
- Network tab shows successful OPTIONS and POST requests
- Response headers include `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`

---

### Issue #5: Backend Endpoints Missing

**Problem**: 
Frontend was sending pings but receiving 404 errors for `/api/ping` and `/api/health` endpoints.

**Root Cause**:
Backend endpoints were not implemented yet.

**Solution Implemented**:
Added both endpoints to `backend/server.js`:

```javascript
// Keep-alive tracking
const serverHealth = {
    startTime: Date.now(),
    lastPing: Date.now(),
    nextPing: Date.now() + (10 * 60 * 1000),
    pingCount: 0,
    pingInterval: 10 * 60 * 1000,
    status: 'active'
};

// Ping endpoint
app.post("/api/ping", (req, res) => {
    serverHealth.lastPing = Date.now();
    serverHealth.nextPing = Date.now() + serverHealth.pingInterval;
    serverHealth.pingCount++;
    serverHealth.status = 'active';
    
    console.log(`Keep-alive ping received (#${serverHealth.pingCount})`);
    
    res.status(200).json({
        message: "Pong",
        timestamp: serverHealth.lastPing,
        nextPing: serverHealth.nextPing
    });
});

// Health endpoint
app.get("/api/health", (req, res) => {
    // ... implementation
});

// Helper function
function formatDuration(ms) {
    // ... implementation
}
```

**Important**: These endpoints MUST be defined BEFORE `server.listen()` and module export.

**Verification**:
```bash
# Test locally:
curl -X POST http://localhost:5050/api/ping
# Should return: {"message":"Pong","timestamp":...,"nextPing":...}

curl http://localhost:5050/api/health
# Should return: {"status":"active","uptime":{...},"lastPing":{...},...}
```

### Issue #6: Hard-Coded Backend URL

**Problem**: 
Backend URL was hard-coded in `keepalive.js`, causing issues when testing locally.

**Root Cause**:
Originally had:
```javascript
this.apiUrl = 'https://my-app.onrender.com'; // Always points to production
```

**Solution Implemented**:
Dynamic environment detection:

```javascript
// Determine API URL dynamically
const isLocalhost = window.location.hostname === 'localhost' || window.location.hostname === '127.0.0.1';
this.apiUrl = isLocalhost 
    ? 'http://localhost:5050' 
    : 'https://collaborative-whiteboard-i6ri.onrender.com';
```

**Benefits**:
- Works automatically in local development
- Works automatically in production
- No manual switching needed
- Can test both environments easily

**Verification**:
```javascript
// In browser console:
window.keepAliveService.apiUrl
// Local: "http://localhost:5050"
// Production: "https://your-app.onrender.com"
```

---

### Issue #7: Ping Interval Too Long

**Problem**: 
Initial implementation used 10-minute ping interval, which wasn't aggressive enough. Server could still shut down if a single ping failed.

**Root Cause**:
- Render shuts down after 15 minutes
- 10-minute interval = only 1-2 pings within shutdown window
- If one ping fails, server goes cold

**Solution Implemented**:
Two-tier interval system:

```javascript
this.shortInterval = 2 * 60 * 1000;  // 2 minutes - aggressive
this.longInterval = 4 * 60 * 1000;   // 4 minutes - maintenance
```

**Logic**:
1. Start with 2-minute pings (aggressive)
2. After 3 successful pings ‚Üí switch to 4-minute pings
3. On ANY failure ‚Üí reset to 2-minute pings

**Math**:
- 4-minute interval = 3-4 pings within 15-minute window
- Provides redundancy if 1-2 pings fail
- Server stays warm with minimal resource usage

**Verification**:
```javascript
// Check current interval:
window.keepAliveService.getStatus()
// Initial: currentInterval: 120000 (2 minutes)
// After warmup: currentInterval: 240000 (4 minutes)
```

---

### Issue #8: No Cold Start Detection

**Problem**: 
Couldn't tell if server was cold or just slow network.

**Root Cause**:
No response time tracking in ping function.

**Solution Implemented**:
Added response time tracking and logging:

```javascript
async ping() {
    const startTime = Date.now();
    
    try {
        const response = await fetch(this.pingEndpoint, {...});
        const responseTime = Date.now() - startTime;
        
        // Log response time to detect cold starts
        if (responseTime > 5000) {
            console.log(`[KeepAlive] Ping successful (server was cold, took ${(responseTime/1000).toFixed(1)}s)`);
        } else {
            console.log(`[KeepAlive] Ping successful (${responseTime}ms)`);
        }
    }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Easy to identify cold starts in logs
- Helps diagnose slow pings vs. cold starts
- Useful for monitoring and debugging

**Verification**:
```
// Cold start:
[KeepAlive] Ping successful (server was cold, took 14.2s)

// Warm server:
[KeepAlive] Ping successful (456ms)
```

### Issue #9: Tab Visibility Not Handled

**Problem**: 
When users switched away from tab, pings stopped in some browsers.

**Root Cause**:
Browsers throttle background tabs to save resources.

**Solution Implemented**:
Added visibility change detection:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', () => {
    if (!document.hidden && window.keepAliveService) {
        if (!window.keepAliveService.isActive) {
            window.keepAliveService.start();
            console.log('[KeepAlive] Restarted on visibility change');
        } else {
            // Send an immediate ping when user returns
            window.keepAliveService.ping();
            console.log('[KeepAlive] Immediate ping on visibility change');
        }
    }
});
```

**Benefits**:
- Resumes pinging when user returns to tab
- Sends immediate ping to check server status
- Handles browser tab throttling

**Verification**:
1. Open page
2. Switch to another tab for a while
3. Return to original tab
4. Check console for visibility change message

### Issue #10: No Continuous Background Ping Option

**Problem**: 
Keep-alive only worked when users were actively visiting the site. If no users visited for 15+ minutes, server would shut down.

**Root Cause**:
- Original design relied on user visits
- No mechanism for automated 24/7 pinging

**Solution Implemented**:
Added "Continuous Background Ping" feature to health dashboard:

**Features**:
- Toggle button to enable/disable
- 5-minute ping interval
- Persists state in localStorage
- Counts background pings sent
- Shows last ping response time
- Works independently of user visits

**Code Location**: `frontend/health.html` (lines ~330-530)

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Start continuous ping
function startContinuousPing() {
    continuousPingEnabled = true;
    sendContinuousPing(); // Immediate ping
    
    continuousPingInterval = setInterval(() => {
        sendContinuousPing();
    }, 5 * 60 * 1000); // Every 5 minutes
    
    localStorage.setItem('continuousPingEnabled', 'true');
}

// Restore state on page load
function restoreContinuousPingState() {
    const wasEnabled = localStorage.getItem('continuousPingEnabled') === 'true';
    if (wasEnabled) {
        startContinuousPing();
    }
}
```

**Usage**:
1. Visit `/health.html`
2. Click "‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start Continuous Ping"
3. Close browser/tab
4. Server receives pings every 5 minutes
5. State persists across page reloads

**Verification**:
- Check localStorage: `localStorage.getItem('continuousPingEnabled')`
- Check server logs for ping count increasing
- Leave tab open and check console every 5 minutes

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Wrong Script Order
‚ùå **Don't**:
```html
<script type="module" src="script.js"></script>
<script src="keepalive.js"></script>
```

‚úÖ **Do**:
```html
<script src="keepalive.js"></script>
<script type="module" src="script.js"></script>
```

### 2. Forgetting to Update Backend URL
‚ùå **Don't**:
```javascript
this.apiUrl = 'https://collaborative-whiteboard-i6ri.onrender.com'; // Old project URL
```

‚úÖ **Do**:
```javascript
const isLocalhost = window.location.hostname === 'localhost';
this.apiUrl = isLocalhost 
    ? 'http://localhost:5050' 
    : 'https://YOUR-NEW-APP.onrender.com'; // Your actual URL
```

### 3. Endpoints After server.listen()
‚ùå **Don't**:
```javascript
server.listen(PORT, () => {...});

app.post("/api/ping", ...); // Too late! Won't register
```

‚úÖ **Do**:
```javascript
app.post("/api/ping", ...); // Define BEFORE listen

server.listen(PORT, () => {...});
```

### 4. No CORS Configuration
‚ùå **Don't**: Forget CORS headers

‚úÖ **Do**:
```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
    res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS');
    res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept, Authorization');
    if (req.method === 'OPTIONS') return res.sendStatus(200);
    next();
});
```

### 5. Not Testing Cold Start
‚ùå **Don't**: Only test with warm server

‚úÖ **Do**:
1. Deploy to Render
2. Wait 20+ minutes
3. Visit frontend
4. Verify server wakes up
5. Check console for cold start message

## üîß Debugging Commands

### Check if keepalive.js is Loaded
```javascript
// In browser console:
typeof window.keepAliveService
// Should return: "object"
```

### Get Current Status
```javascript
window.keepAliveService.getStatus()
// Returns: {isActive, currentInterval, lastPingTime, ...}
```

### Manually Trigger Ping
```javascript
window.keepAliveService.ping()
// Check console for response
```

### Check localStorage
```javascript
localStorage.getItem('continuousPingEnabled')
// Returns: "true" or "false" or null
```

### Test Backend Endpoint
```bash
# Terminal:
curl -X POST https://your-app.onrender.com/api/ping
curl https://your-app.onrender.com/api/health
```

### Monitor Network Requests
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Filter: "ping"
4. Watch for POST requests every 2-4 minutes

## üìù Deployment Checklist

Use this checklist for new projects:

- [ ] Copy `keepalive.js` to `frontend/` directory
- [ ] Update Render URL in `keepalive.js` (line ~13)
- [ ] Add `<script src="keepalive.js"></script>` to ALL HTML files
- [ ] Copy backend endpoints to `server.js`:
  - [ ] `serverHealth` object
  - [ ] `/api/ping` POST endpoint
  - [ ] `/api/health` GET endpoint
  - [ ] `formatDuration()` helper function
- [ ] Add CORS middleware in `server.js`
- [ ] Verify endpoints are BEFORE `server.listen()`
- [ ] Test locally:
  - [ ] `npm start` in backend
  - [ ] Open `http://localhost:5050`
  - [ ] Check console for keep-alive logs
  - [ ] Verify `/api/ping` and `/api/health` respond
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel (frontend)
- [ ] Deploy to Render (backend)
- [ ] Test production:
  - [ ] Wait 15+ minutes
  - [ ] Visit Vercel URL
  - [ ] Check console for cold start message
  - [ ] Verify server wakes up in ~15-20 seconds
- [ ] Optional: Enable continuous ping in `/health.html`

---

## üí° Lessons Learned

1. **Start Aggressive, Then Relax**: Use short intervals initially, then switch to longer intervals once server is proven stable.

2. **Defensive Programming**: Always handle failures and automatically retry with more aggressive settings.

3. **Environment Detection**: Never hard-code URLs; always detect environment dynamically.

4. **Universal Coverage**: Include keep-alive on ALL pages, not just the homepage.

5. **Monitor Everything**: Add logging to track cold starts, ping success/failure, and interval switching.

6. **Persist State**: Use localStorage to maintain continuous ping across page reloads.

7. **User Transparency**: Make keep-alive operations transparent and give users control (health dashboard).

8. **Test Edge Cases**: Always test cold starts, failures, and long inactivity periods.
