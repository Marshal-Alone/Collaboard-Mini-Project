## 🎯 Quick Start (For Future Projects)

### Step 1: Copy Files
```bash
# Copy keepalive.js to new project
cp frontend/keepalive.js /path/to/new-project/frontend/

# Copy documentation for reference
cp KEEPALIVE_*.md /path/to/new-project/
```

### Step 2: Update Configuration
Open `keepalive.js` and update line ~13:
```javascript
this.apiUrl = isLocalhost 
    ? 'http://localhost:YOUR_PORT' 
    : 'https://your-new-app.onrender.com'; // ← Change this
```

### Step 3: Add to HTML Files
Add to every HTML page in `<head>`:
```html
<script src="keepalive.js"></script>
```

### Step 4: Add Backend Endpoints
Copy from this project's `server.js` (lines ~1093-1186):
- `serverHealth` object
- `app.post("/api/ping", ...)`
- `app.get("/api/health", ...)`
- `formatDuration()` function

### Step 5: Deploy & Test
```bash
# Deploy
vercel --prod          # Frontend
git push render main   # Backend

# Test
# 1. Wait 15+ minutes
# 2. Visit frontend
# 3. Check console for: "[KeepAlive] Ping successful (server was cold, took X.Xs)"
```

## 🔍 Quick Diagnostics

### Problem: Pings not sending
```javascript
// Check in browser console:
typeof window.keepAliveService  // Should be "object"
window.keepAliveService.getStatus()  // Check isActive: true
```

### Problem: 404 errors on /api/ping
```bash
# Test backend directly:
curl -X POST https://your-app.onrender.com/api/ping
# Should return: {"message":"Pong",...}
```

### Problem: CORS errors
Check `server.js` has CORS middleware BEFORE routes:
```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
    // ...
});
```

### Problem: Server still sleeping
Reduce intervals in `keepalive.js`:
```javascript
shortInterval: 90 * 1000,   // 90 seconds (more aggressive)
longInterval: 3 * 60 * 1000 // 3 minutes
```

### Key Features
- ✅ Immediate wake-up on page load
- ✅ Two-tier interval system (2min → 4min)
- ✅ Automatic error recovery
- ✅ Cold start detection
- ✅ Tab visibility handling
- ✅ Continuous background ping option
- ✅ Works on all pages
- ✅ Environment auto-detection

---

## 🎛️ Configuration

### Default Settings
```javascript
shortInterval: 2 * 60 * 1000,   // 2 minutes
longInterval: 4 * 60 * 1000,    // 4 minutes
consecutiveSuccessThreshold: 3   // Switch after 3 successes
```

### Recommended Adjustments

**More Aggressive** (if server still sleeps):
```javascript
shortInterval: 90 * 1000,       // 90 seconds
longInterval: 3 * 60 * 1000,    // 3 minutes
```

**More Conservative** (to reduce requests):
```javascript
shortInterval: 3 * 60 * 1000,   // 3 minutes
longInterval: 5 * 60 * 1000,    // 5 minutes
```

**24/7 Uptime** (use continuous ping):
- Visit `/health.html`
- Click "▶️ Start Continuous Ping"
- Server receives pings every 5 minutes regardless of user visits

### Production Testing
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel + Render
- [ ] Wait 15+ minutes (server goes cold)
- [ ] Visit Vercel URL
- [ ] Check console for cold start log
- [ ] Verify server wakes up in ~15-20 seconds
- [ ] Monitor pings continue automatically

### Health Dashboard Testing
- [ ] Visit `/health.html`
- [ ] Verify metrics display correctly
- [ ] Test "Send Ping Now" button
- [ ] Test "Pause/Resume Auto-Refresh"
- [ ] Test "Start Continuous Ping"
- [ ] Reload page, verify continuous ping still active
- [ ] Check localStorage: `continuousPingEnabled`
